Letters from Cornell Engineering faculty and staff should be formatted using this MSWord template. This template uses Verdana as the default font. Verdana is very similar in appearance to Cornell Engineering’s official font, Roobert. Because Verdana is included with MSWord, it is more readily available for all correspondents. 

If you would like access to Roobert for business purposes or have questions about how to use this template, please contact Cornell Engineering’s Marketing and Communications office.

%this newpage is here just to show how the second page differs from the first
\newpage

You may modify this template to suit your needs, including selecting an alternative font that is professional and accessible. Always use at least size 12 font and avoid using all caps except for acronyms. Please try to keep the format of your communications as consistent as possible.


\closing{Sincerely,}


\end{letter}
